# Sn채llisBot
Making the world better, one tweet at a time. Sending love to all Swedish twitter users. Inspired by the awesome [@TheNiceBot](https://twitter.com/TheNiceBot).

## Setup
* Clone, download or fork this repository.
* Locate the GsTwitterBot folder, and copy the file "apikeys_template.py" to "apikeys.py"
* Open the newly renamed "apikeys.py" and fill in your api keys, as obtained from https://apps.twitter.com.
* Open "setup.py" and fill in the necessary information.
* Run by writing "python3 mainbot.py" in your terminal. (Make sure python 3 is installed, or try with python 2 at your own risk.)

## Compatibility

Should support all python 3+ versions. It may run on python 2.x, but there will probably need to be some modifications, particularly with string encodings.

Has only been tested to work on python 3.4.

## Dependencies

Currently relies on [Twython](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython) for connecting to the Twitter APIs in an effortless way.

## Project status
* Sn채llisBot is actively developed by @ArVID220u as a side project, irregularly.
* Sn채llisBot is definitely not in a release-ready state yet. Thus, there are numerous unstable commits in-between the stable ones.
* I invite you to join me in developing Sn채llisBot, in our quest to make the world a little better. You can do this by forking and then issuing pull requests, or contacting me directly with the purpose of getting contribution privileges.
